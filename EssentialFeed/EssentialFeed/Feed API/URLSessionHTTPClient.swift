// So the production implementation for Client, would be a real request for the API.
// We need to be able to test it first because we don't have API yet 🤗
// What will happen at the end of the day is a URLSession -> DataTaskWith(url) request, that return a completion block.
// So the RemoteClient will have the Session that do that ☝️
// And will have an API method get(from url) that will be the window to shot for the request.
// So Client has a Session 😉
//Test behaviour, not framework (production) details
// So you free the production from any testing constrains 🆓
// Implement and maintain Only what you care about 👌
